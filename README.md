Tic-Tac-Toe GUI that accepts input between 2 players on the same computer. Gathers user input through the use of event listeners. The game board is encapsulated as an object (module, to be specific) that has private properties/methods as well as public ones, all of which can update the board state whenever a player enters input during their turn, as well as determine if there is a winner or if the game is tied at the end of each turn. Each player is an instance from a factory function which creates new player objects. The main role of each of these objects is to keep track of whose turn it is.
